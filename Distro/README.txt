This readme is for Invisicar v1.0

Invisicar is a NOVELTY Mod, which makes you and the vehicle you're in invisible (or varying levels of transparency). 
With settings to adjust 'how' invisible you and your car become, ranging from completely invisible (even to you!) 
all the way to no change (not sure why you'd want this!) and everything in between, ditch the cops, steal that boat 
or car without a chase, or just zip around the map pretending you're a ghost and make a movie of it. 

Hopefully you this mod as much as I did and enjoyed making it!

Installation

- Install both the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 (or higher, so skip this on Windows 10) (available here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) and the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2019 (x64) (Available Here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
- Download and install the leeeeeatest Script Hook V (Available here: https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/script-hook-v).
- Download The latest Script Hook .NET Version 2.X (From GITHUB, HERE: https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/releases/download/v2.10.10/ScriptHookVDotNet.zip) and copy the ScriptHookVDotNet.asi, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll files into your game directory.
- Create a Directory "Scripts" in your game directory
- Place Invisicar.DLL AND Invisicar.INI in the "Scripts" directory

That's it for the setup!

Usage:
- NUMBER KEY 0 TO Toggle the MOD Off and On (A message should show the load/unload is successful above the minimap) 
- THE DECIMAL on the NUMKEYPAD to toggle the effect while within a vehicle (car/plane/boat,etc)

For more detailed customizations, the INI File has the following settings:
# Application Wide Settings
[App Settings]
# This setting defines the key which toggles this mod on and off 
keyToggleModOnOff=NumPad0
# This setting defines the key which toggles invisibility
# DEFAULT VALUE = NumPadDelete
keyToggleInvisibility=NumPadDelete
# This setting defines HOw invisible to make the car (or other vehicles you decide to inhabit)
# Valid Values Range from 0 (totally invisible) to 100 (totally visible, no real effect discernable)
# DEFAULT VALUE = 20 (almost completely transparent) 
nPercentageOfInvisibility=20
# This setting determines if the PLAYER and OCCUPANTS of the vehicle, WHILE RIDING in the vehicle
# become invisible too. While I prefer NOT making the players and occupants invisible, this lets you choose. 
bIncludePlayerAndPassengers=true
# This setting determines the speed of the change. Does it become transparent instantly, or is it a more 
# chameleon-like gradual shift. I prefer the chameleon. 
bChameleonLikeTransparency=true


Enjoy!
